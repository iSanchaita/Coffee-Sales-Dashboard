# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
## Introduction
This project features an interactive Excel dashboard built to visualize and explore coffee sales data for a fictional coffee retailer. It helps uncover key business insights, such as sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance, all in a simple, user-friendly format.
## Business Problem
The sales and marketing team lacked a centralized, intuitive view of their sales performance across countries, customer segments, and product types. As a result, decision-making was reactive and not data-driven.
## Goal
Develop a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard to monitor coffee sales trends over time. Deliver insights into top customers and high-performing countries based on key product attributes such as roast type, size, and coffee variety.Enable fast filtering and data slicing to support strategic decisions related to marketing campaigns, inventory management, and customer targeting.
## Walking Through the Key Visuals
•	Slicers – Include a timeline filter to track sales over different periods, along with filters for roast type, loyalty card status, coffee size, and coffee type for detailed analysis.
•	Line Chart – Sales Over Time – Shows monthly sales by coffee type to spot seasonal trends and low-performing periods.
• Bar Chart – Sales by Country – Displays how much revenue comes from each country, with the U.S. as the top contributor.
• Bar Chart – Top 5 Customers – Highlights the five customers who spend the most, helping with loyalty and customer retention planning.
## Highlighting the Insights
•	The United States accounts for the highest sales revenue.

# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
## Introduction
This project is an Excel-based interactive dashboard designed to visualize and analyze coffee sales data for a fictional coffee retailer. 
## Business Problem
The sales and marketing team lacked a centralized, intuitive view of their sales performance across countries, customer segments, and product types. As a result, decision-making was reactive and not data-driven.
## Goal
•	Build a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard to track coffee sales trends over time.
•	Provide insights into top customers, high-performing countries based on popular product attributes like roast type, size, coffee type.
•	Enable quick filtering and data slicing to support business decisions related to marketing campaigns, inventory, and customer targeting.
